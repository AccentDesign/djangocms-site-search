****************************************
Django model based search for Django CMS
****************************************

|PyPI_Version| |Build_Status| |Coverage_Status|

The reason I created this was simply to avoid the overhead of using third party applications such as haystack.
I was deploying an app on Amazons Elastic Beanstalk that will run on one or more instance and did not
want the hassle of trying to save the index results in a centralized storage. I also did not want another instance
just to act as a search endpoint like solr etc.

Doing it this way by saving the results in the database makes it extremely portable.


************
Installation
************

Installation with ``pip``::

    $ pip install djangocms-site-search

On publishing a page, an index item is added to the model.
On unpublishing or deleting its removed. Simple!


*****
Setup
*****

Add the following apps to the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` ensuring its below cms::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'cms',
        'site_search',
    )

Add the url routes to the project in urls.py::

    urlpatterns = [
        url(r'^', include('site_search.urls', 'search')),
    ]
